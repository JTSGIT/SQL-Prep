For a concise, memorizable preparation for your SQL interview, let's distill the essentials into bullet points and simplified examples.

### Key SQL Concepts

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete data.
- **DDL vs. DML**: Data Definition Language (CREATE, ALTER, DROP) vs. Data Manipulation Language (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- **JOINs**: Combine rows from two or more tables.
- **Aggregation**: SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN.
- **Grouping**: GROUP BY, HAVING for aggregate conditions.
- **Subqueries/CTEs**: Queries within queries / Named temporary result sets.

### Simplified Query Examples

1. **SELECT**:
   ```sql
   SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 25;
   ```
2. **JOIN**:
   ```sql
   SELECT a.name, b.department FROM employees a JOIN departments b ON a.dept_id = b.id;
   ```
3. **Aggregation**:
   ```sql
   SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY dept_id;
   ```
4. **Subquery**:
   ```sql
   SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
   ```
5. **CTE**:
   ```sql
   WITH avg_salaries AS (SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal FROM employees GROUP BY dept_id)
   SELECT * FROM avg_salaries;
   ```

### Tips for Application

- **Data Analysis**: Use `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions to analyze grouped data.
- **JOINs for Data Integrity**: Use appropriate JOIN types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) based on data relationships.
- **Query Optimization**: Index frequently queried columns; consider execution plans.

Keep your explanations straightforward and focus on how each concept or query can be used to solve common database problems or answer data-related questions. This condensed guide should help you quickly recall SQL fundamentals and demonstrate your capability to apply SQL to solve problems during your interview.
